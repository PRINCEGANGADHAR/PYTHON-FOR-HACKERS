Python is one of the most popular programming languages today, known for its simplicity, versatility, and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s, with its first official release in 1991. Guido designed Python with a vision to create a language that would allow programmers to write clean, easy-to-read code while still being powerful enough to handle complex tasks.

The inspiration for Python came from Guido's desire to build a successor to the ABC programming language, which focused on teaching programming and prototyping. However, Python was designed to be much more robust and flexible. Over the years, it has evolved into a language used in various fields such as web development, data science, automation, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity.
